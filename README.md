# Hi there, I'm Sreekanth KN! 👋
### Cyber Security Researcher | Python Developer | Founder of Cognitive Web Solutions

I am a security enthusiast and developer based in Kozhikode, currently part of the **Cyber Security Course II Batch at Blitz Academy**. My passion lies in understanding network protocols at the packet level and building custom tools to secure them.

I bridge the gap between security research and practical business applications through my platform, **[Cognitive Web Solutions](http://cognitivewebsolutions.com)**.
